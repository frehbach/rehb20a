The supplementary material of this work includes the following Figures and Tables:
-convergenceMlrOnBBOB.pdf
	Convergence plots of SBO-EI and SBO-PV on all 24 BBOB functions. 
	Experiments are run with the implementations of the R-Package MlrMBO. 
	The experiments are run (from left to right) on 2,3,5, and 10 input-dimensions. 
	The y-Axis shows the best so far achieved objective function value on a logarithmic scale. 
	The center line indicates the median of the algorithm repeats. 
	The surrounding ribbon marks the lower and upper quartiles.
	Y-Values measure difference from the global function optimum.
-convergenceSpotOnBBOB.pdf
	Convergence plots of SBO-EI and SBO-PV on all 24 BBOB functions. 
	Experiments are run with the implementations of the R-Package SPOT. 
	Random search added as baseline. The experiments are run (from left to right) on 2,3,5, and 10 input-dimensions. 
	The y-Axis shows the best so far achieved objective function value on a logarithmic scale. 
	The center line indicates the median of the algorithm repeats. 
	The surrounding ribbon marks the lower and upper quartiles.
	Y-Values measure difference from the global function optimum.
-pathDistanceMLRonBBOB.pdf
	Distance Measurement of proposed candidate solutions during optimization to their nearest neighbor. 
	Experiments are run with the implementations of the R-Package MlrMBO. 
	The y-Axis shows the measured euclidean distance. 
	The experiments are run (from left to right) on 2,3,5, and 10 input-dimensions. 
	The center line indicates the median of the algorithm repeats.

-surveyOfFrameworks.pdf
	Overview of surveyed SBO frameworks. 
	The table shows the respective framework name, programming language and default infill criterion. 
	(Expected Improvement - EI, Predicted Value - PV, Upper/Lower Confidence Bound - CB, PI - Probability of Improvement). 
	This is followed by information whether EI/PV or other criteria are choosable, even if not as default setting.
-tilesMlr.pdf
	Statistical analysis of difference in performance between SBO-EI vs. SBO-PV. 
	Experiments are run with the implementations of the R-Package MlrMBO. 
	Y-Axis shows the BBOB-function index. 
	Colors indicate which infill criterion performed better in each case, based on the statistical test procedure. 
	No-Fill indicates that there was no significant difference found.
	The results are presented for the 2,3,5 and 10 dimensional BBOB-function set as indicated to the right of each plot.
